## Extended personal questions

### @aidnurs

-   Backend fails in PR #48

    PR is almost finished. The last thing to do is to fix the deployment pipeline. The problem is that the renaming of the `variety` table into `plants` table is not reflected in the backend code. The backend code still refers to the `variety` table. Should I replace all the backend namings(entities, services, etc.) from `variety` into `plants`?

-   Discuss new use cases for map layers #66

    Dive deeper into the new use cases and discuss them with the team.

-   Discuss versions for layers #67
-   Present new mockups for the map layers
    You can find the new mockups under the following link:

    I will also link them in the documentation later.

-   Why don't we merge meeting PRs yet?
