## Changelogs

**Please push progress important changes devs should know, e.g. decisions, in items with syntax `- change _(Your Name)_` below:**

- KeyCloak: users with name `test*` removed, please use same nickname as in Nextcloud _(Markus Raab)_
- Clarification: Polygon relates to map, even if it is shown in base layer. _(Markus Raab)_
- Problem with Nextcloud CORS configuration:
  Nextcloud has no options to configure the allowed origins for CORS requests.
  There is a plugin to circumvent this problem for some APIs but this plugins is considered unsecure by a Nextcloud Spreed team member.
  It also doesn't work with the Nextcloud Spreed APIs.
  My suggestion is to implement a proxy for setting the correct CORS headers in our backend. _(Samuel Daurer)_
- Items can now only be selected on their corresponding layers. _(Samuel Daurer)_
- Basic chat utils for Nextcloud are introduced in PR #428 in /features/nextcloud_integration/api/chat.ts (NOTE: not working in production due to CORS issues) _(Samuel Daurer)_
- Nextcloud image utils not working in production due to CORS issues right now _(Samuel Daurer)_
- Map Creation now includes description, privacy settings and selecting a geographical location. _(Thorben Staufer)_
- A new map will automatically store the creator as its owner through the user data provided by the Keycloak token (in PR #449). _(Thorben Staufer)_
- The map overview page only shows maps created by the currently logged-in user (in PR #449). _(Thorben Staufer)_
- Proposed a DB design for simple layers (layers that either place objects or contain a map-wide configuration) with the plants layer as an example (in PR #427). _(Gabriel Kitzberger & Thorben Staufer)_
- Documentation about backend now in mdbook including auth and how to obtain tokens (PR #412) _(Gabriel Kitzberger)_
- Allow for searching maps by name (PR #414) _(Gabriel Kitzberger)_
- Send changes to the map to other connected clients via Server Side Events (PR #404) _(Paul Buschmann & Gabriel Kitzberger)_
