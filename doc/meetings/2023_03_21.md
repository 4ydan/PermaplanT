## Progress Reports:

### Focus Group 'Gamification'
-   We defined the primary goals of the game aspect of PermaplanT (increasing positive gardening behaviour, encouraging collaboration on maps, providing a fun environment for class room learning).
-   We identified a usage scenario in citizen science: multiple growers, potentially working with experts, working together to evaluate and optimize known companions and their performance through a serious game type of parallel simulations and real-life analysis of the results.
-   We brainstormed a list of potential use cases around this citizen science scenario and the idea of collaboration on a shared map to help lesser experienced gardeners with their design through various forms of reviews.

### Focus Group 'Polyculture'
-   We are developing the app for the middle european climate zone.
-   We have to define plant traits we want to focus on for trait based matching.
-   We need to find high quality data on plant traits and known companions.
