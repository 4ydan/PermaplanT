## Questions from Lukas and Markus:

1. Should we pin the rust version in any way, or is it ok to always use the latest version?
    - we use latest
2. How should we handle the situation during build? (no Postgres, etc.)
 
3. How do we inject the correct `BASE_URL` for the backend into the frontend?

    - .env file

## Meeting notes:

Updates from Markus:
