-   Tips for your thesis:
    -   Forschungstagebuch
    -   speed
    -   look at other thesis
-   working together for thesis
-   PRs with generic issues (use cases #1, decisions #2), don't need extra issues just for the PR
-   paper
    -   how to write methodology
    -   hypothesis?
    -   what is important for RQs
-   how to write decisions
-   merging policy: own PRs should not be merged by yourself, others are okay if you are sure it is okay and it solves a problem for you (e.g. fixes builds).
-   outcome of backend meeting:
    -   we want to use Swagger
    -   decisions: prefer to simply push
-   Milestones
    -   KW14: introduction&methods, implementation mostly done (eastern)
    -   KW17: related work, implementation finished
    -   KW20: abstract&conclusion, RQs answered
    -   KW23: submission of complete thesis, all tasks done (only fixing of unknown bugs remains)
    -   you can always do more
-   short news from our focus teams
    -   Backend
-   assignment of one use cases
-   progress reports
    -   Samuel
        - added env file with API_URL to frontend
        - defined color structure in tailwind
        - implemented landing page suggestions and dark mode
        - stuck at accessing values from tailwind configuration (typescript errors)
-   questions from team
    -   Samuel
        - When are PRs merged?
        - How to avoid duplicate effort? 
          E.g. I am working on simple components that I need for my feature other people might need similar components for different feature.
          Should we create smaller PRs that get merged fast? E.g. SimpleButton improvement PR

Break, and then:

-   Frontend Team kick-off
