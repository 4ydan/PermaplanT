## Changelogs

**Auth:**

- now active, requires either a user on https://auth.permaplant.net/ (can be aquired by visiting https://pr.permaplant.net/, clicking login and register) or a local setup of Keycloak (see readme in backend)
- doc on how to obtain tokens for local development is still missing (e.g. OAuth2 via Postman or curl)
- local swagger doc broken (tracked by #383)

**Nextcloud:**

- introduced webdav library
- introduced utility functions for fetching and uploading images to Nextcloud as well as a webdav test component (webdav-test.tsx) for testing this functionality.
It is currently available at /webdav
- disable CORS in your browser for Nextcloud feature development:
e.g.
```
google-chrome --disable-web-security

```
or
```
chromium --disable-web-security

```
This is needed to allow requests which are not under the some origin.
More info about Nextcloud setup in /doc/setups/nextcloud/README.md

**map state management:**

The state is now split in two parts namely tracked and untracked map store.
More info about the state management of layers in the map editor is available in /doc/architecture/frontend.md
