## Questions

**Please push questions in items below:**

- Samuel:
  - Can we clean up PRs?
- Benjamin:
  - Can I clean up the backend structure? Some things seem messy.
    - Both `entity` and `dto` exists as file and directory in the `model` package.
      Shouldn't they both be a regular package of their own?
    - Both `entity` and `dto` split each struct and it's function implementations across two files.
      Wouldn't it make more sense to put struct and functions together into one file for each?
    - Why is `dto` part of the service layer?
      As this is the way we represent data in the api it fits better as subpackage of `controller`.
    - Intersection of layers.
      The service layer should be the one acting between controllers and database.
      Why do controllers get the database connection pool as argument when this would better fit the service layer?
      Why does the database layer handle mapping from entity to dto when this should belong in the service layer?
