# Coordinate System

The backend uses the same coordinate system as the frontend.

This means that (0,0) is in the top left corner.  
The x-value increases when going to the right and the y-value increases when going down.

The scale is set to be in cm, so increasing x by 1 would mean going to the right by 1cm.

The granularity of the heatmap is set to 10cm via the constant `GRANULARITY`.  
This means that the heatmap is generated by dividing the maps geometry into 10x10cm squares for each of which a score is computed.
