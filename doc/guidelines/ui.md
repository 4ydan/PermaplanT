# UI

## Submitting Data

Data should be always submitted on-the-fly but with debouncing.

## Okay Buttons

If needed, the confirming button should be on the left.

## Gender

Use plural to avoid gender, avoid he/she.

## Raster

We raster per pixel, which should represent 1cm in reality.
Geometric operations that produce results not in that raster, should be rounded.
In the state or in the backend only integer values should be used.

## Key bindings

A JSON file is responsible for global key bindings.

## Colors

Currently written about in [#194](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/issues/194).
