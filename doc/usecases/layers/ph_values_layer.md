## Summary

- **Scope:** pH Values Layer
- **Level:** User Goal
- **Actors:** App User
- **Brief:** The user can add and edit pH values in their plan using the pH values layer
- **Status:** Draft

## Scenarios

- **Precondition:**
  The user has opened the app and has selected the pH values layer.
- **Main success scenario:**
  The user successfully adds, moves and edits pH values in their plan using the pH values layer. This includes positioning the pH value indicators in the appropriate locations and adjusting their values as needed.

- **Non-functional Constraints:**
  - The app must clearly communicate to the user the constraints for editing pH values in the pH values layer.
