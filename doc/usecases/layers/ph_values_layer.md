# Use Case: pH Values Layer

## Summary

- **Scope:** pH Values Layer
- **Level:** User Goal
- **Actors:** App User
- **Brief:** The user can add, move, delete and edit areas of pH values in their map using the pH values layer
- **Status:** Draft

## Scenarios

- **Precondition:**
  The user has opened the app and has selected the pH values layer.
- **Main success scenario:**
  The user successfully adds, moves, deletes and edits pH value areas in their map using the pH values layer. 
  This includes positioning the pH value areas in the appropriate locations and adjusting their values as needed.
  pH Value areas can be added by a big brush to draw on the ph Value layer.
- **Alternative scenario:**
  The user accidentally adds or moves a pH value area in the wrong location and uses the app's undo function to correct the mistake.
- **Error scenario:**
  The user attempts to edit a pH value in a area that is not within the acceptable range (e.g. below 0 or above 14) and the app displays an error message.
- **Postcondition:**
  The user's map includes the added, moved or edited pH value areas as desired.
- **Non-functional Constraints:**
  - The app must clearly communicate to the user the constraints for editing pH values in the pH values layer.
