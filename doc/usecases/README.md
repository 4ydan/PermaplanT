# Usecases

This folder contains all use cases of PermaplanT.

They are structured in folders by progress:

- `draft`: something is yet unclear about the use case
- `assigned`: use case could be implemented but is not part of current milestone
- `current`: use case is currently implemented (within milestone)
- `done`: use case was successfully implemented

## Done

A use case is done once:

- documentation: clear for others how changes/extensions should be done
- integration tests: demonstrate what works
- issues closed: moved to Done in https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4/views/1
- move use case to folder "done"
- add links from use case to implementation/documentation
- write Changelog for meeting
