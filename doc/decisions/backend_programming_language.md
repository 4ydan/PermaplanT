# Backend Programming Language

## Problem

When selecting a backend programming language, a major issue is the range of options available, each with its own strengths and capabilities. This makes it challenging to determine the best language for a particular project or application. Factors to consider include performance, scalability, security, and the availability of developers and support.

## Constraints

- The language must be performant and easily maintainable

## Assumptions

## Considered Alternatives

- Kotlin
- Python
- JavaScript

## Decision

Rust has a growing community of developers and a robust ecosystem of libraries and tools, which can make it easier to build and maintain backend applications.
Overall, Rust's combination of performance, safety, and support make it a viable option for backend development.
