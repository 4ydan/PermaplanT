# Contributing

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/PermaplanT/) to maintain this initiative.

For any non-trival work, there should be an underlying issue.
Make sure the issue is:

- assigned to you and
- ["In Progress" in our project](https://github.com/orgs/ElektraInitiative/projects/4).

Once you created a PR, please request a review from @markus2330, who will also merge.

The first line in commit messages should be short.
From the third line you can have more elaborate descriptions of the changes.
Please refer to #issues/#PRs/@mention as useful.

If requested, and in any case before you start making fundamental changes, create a [decision](/doc/decisions/) before creating a PR.
